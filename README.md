## Overview

This repo provides all scripts, sources, and codes to reproduce the paper **Public Opinions on Sexual Education in Public Schools: An Analysis of Political, Educational,and Generational Influences in the United States from 1972 to 2022âˆ—**. The dataset was retrieved from the General Social Survey (GSS).

## Paper Abstract

This paper analyzes public opinions on sexual education in public schools across the United States, utilizing data from the General Social Survey (GSS) to explore how political affiliations, educational backgrounds, and age demographics shape these views. We discovered that support for sexual education is broadly strong but varies significantly with political ideology, education level, and generational differences, with Democrats, higher-educated individuals, and younger respondents showing the most support. These findings highlight the deep interconnection between personal characteristics and attitudes towards sexual education, reflecting wider societal and cultural debates on the topic. Ultimately, our study underscores the importance of considering diverse perspectives in the formulation and implementation of sexual education policies, revealing the potential for education as a unifying force in addressing public health and societal well-being.
